Each folder include the code for different datasets:
 * `./lass_audio` include code for running separation on *SLAKH* 
 * `./lass_mnist` include code for running separation on *MNIST*


See the `README.md` in each subdirectory for more info on how to install the environment and
run experiments.

  **NOTE: to install the necessary environment it is recommended the user to 
  use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) as environment manager for python.**

The needed checkpoints and data, along with the separation results are all available at this [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZaxOWldpHEQHz_weewhzUly7fwvUCnPN?usp=sharing)
